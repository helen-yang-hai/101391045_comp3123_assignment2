# 101391045_comp3123_assignment2
This is the assignment 2 for comp3123 full stack.
Based on the assignment 1 which is the backend part, I added the frontend part.
The frontend is coded by React, using axios to call backend API to implement CRUD operations for the employee management system.
I used docker to containerized the project.
The database is MongoDB.
I used postman to test API and all requests work as expected.
